              After 24 grueling hours, gallons of sub-par coffee, and more than a few roadblocks, our team of 5 had
              completed a proof of concept for a supply chain tracking software using blockchaining technology. It
              was the winning project of the event.

          <ul>
            <li>
              During my summers as the photographer and videographer for Glorieta Camps,
              I submitted some work to the stock photo site Unsplash. I was fortunate enough to be featured 2 times and to
              have my images downloaded over 180 thousand times and viewed over 14 million times.

          <h2>Alpaca Handling State Champ (2 times)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Now this one is a little harder to explain, but I worked on an alpaca farm from the ages 12-18, and we took
              the animals to the state fair. They had obstacle courses you would take your animal through, and I won two
              years in a row. Still the coolest sounding thing about me.
