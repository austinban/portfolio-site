      <p>
        August 16th, 2013, the day of my birthday, I arrived on Belmont's campus. Over three years later, Belmont
        was the home of the most intensive period of growth I've been through. With a major in computer science and a
        minor in entrepreneurship, no part of my brain has been left untapped. Thanks to my dual credits received
        in high school, I was able to take classes I really wanted to take, such as Web Design and Interactive Media.
