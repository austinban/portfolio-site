              Working for ClassNav has definitely been the most challenging independently led project I have

              Where it all started.
            </h1>
            <p>
              A fellow alumni of the Belmont computer science department and myself started working together on a few small
              projects because of our complimentary skill sets. He was just a blazing fast mind with knowledge of AWS, databases,
              and whatever else he put his mind to. I could make things look pretty on every size of screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Playing off of each other's strong points, we started work on ClassNav's home site. This consisted of taking their
              Squarespace site's general design and cleaning it up in a fully custom site. Built using
              <a target="_blank" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb Foundation</a>, the general frame of the site was done in just a few days.
              After a bit of tweaking and accomidation of their requests, we had their site live.

            <p>
              ClassNav is a syllabus and scheduling app for colleges, so one of their main functions is gathering syllabi
              from students. To do this, we modified a
              <a target="_blank" href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/07/30/fullscreen-form-interface/">submission form from Codrops</a>
              that takes you through the process step by step. We decided to use third party code here to save ourselves some
              headaches, while also saving ClassNav some money on our development costs.

              Now for the real challenge: Creating the dashboard for data scraping syllabi.
            </h1>
            <p>
              In order for ClassNav to function, they needed all of the syllabi submitted through their site to by data
              and put into their database. To do this, my partner and I came up with the dashboard you'll see in pictures
              below.
            </p>
            <h2>This project became the biggest logistical nightmare I had yet encountered. </h2>
            <p>
              For this to work well, it needed
              to be fast and easy to scrape the data, while also being intuitive enough for people who had never seen it before
              to use it. It needed to do this all while ensuring the data was being entered in the same format, even though the
              format used in the syllabi themselves seemed simple. This project deeply solidified for me the belief that these
              things are never as simple as they seem at first glance. There are almost always hidden complexities.

              Having to create designs that fit different amounts of data on different sized screens is a challenge
              that I cherish. It is the exact kind of puzzle that I adore solving. Creating this dashboard required me to
              think of all of the edge cases of great amounts of data, or no data, and how to handle both, while ensuring
              the user gets to what they want as fast as possible.

            <p>
              All of the previous work would have been for naught if the screen to actualy scrape the data didn't work
              well. The page displayed below took hours upon hours of planning, not including the actual development time.
            </p>
            <h2>This page had to:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Render all image types, from .pdf to .gif and everything in between withing the right window.</li>
              <li>Allow people to work on different sections of the syllabus at the same time.</li>
              <li>Accomodate multiple sections on the syllabus.</li>
              <li>Be simple enough to understand intuitively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Whiteboards were filled and erased with mockups of the interface several times, until we were happy with the
              final result.

                Whether this is communication between your fellow developers, your employers, or your employers
                developers, communication is the only way the project will be done accurately and on time. It amazes
                me how easily misunderstandings find their way into the heart of a project and take hours to work
                out, but it could all be avoided by a better communication flow.

              <p>
                In this project, we used a few new frameworks, ranging from a <a href="http://bourbon.io/">SASS library</a>,
                all the way to using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> for the first time. Using all
                of these were a good idea, but we should have tested them on a smaller scale to ensure less bugs in our
                final project.

              <p>
                I have worked on several projects before, but most have fizzled out before finishing due to the lack of
                followthrough or funding. This project showed me how powerful a well designed team can be. Everyone knew
                their role and finished it reasonably on time. It is only because of each person's individual dedication
                that this project was ever finished.
