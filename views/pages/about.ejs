              First off, thanks for taking the time to read this! I'm sure you're busy so I'll keep it short.
            </h1>
            <p>
              To clarify,
              <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality">ENFP&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
              is a personality type (Myers Briggs), as is the
              <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7/">Enneagram 7&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>.</a>
              I find that they help provide a brief snapshot of my personality and values. Now for a little about me!
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of my growing years were spent in Santa Fe, and if you're homeschooled in Santa Fe, you learn how
              to make your own fun. So I started event planning, selling vintage at flea markets, video editing, and
              becoming an avid Youtube tutorial consumer. From these experiences I learned principles of business, management,
              marketing, and self-starting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that I'm a developer and designer in Nashville, all of these skills are more relevant than ever.
              An understanding of business founded in experience and bolstered by a minor in entrepreneurship, and all
              of this backed by the ability to teach myself has allowed me to grow into the developer and designer that I am.
