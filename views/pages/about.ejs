              First off, thanks for taking the time to read this! I'm sure you're busy so I'll keep it short.
            </h1>
            <p>
              I grew up in the desert landscape of Santa Fe, and if youâ€™re homeschooled like I was, you learn how to make your own fun.
              So I started avidly consuming Youtube tutorials, event planning, selling vintage at flea markets, video editing, and working with alpaca farms.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of these ventures showed me the joy of taking an idea and turning it into reality. I was bitten by that bug and couldn't ever go back.
              Because of this, I wanted to develop a skill to build intricate and useful things, and then the knowledge to make those things into a business.
              This manifested as a degree in computer science, with a minor in entrepreneurship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now I work as a frontend developer, merging intuitive design with smart code. My work has gained me a reputation within my workplace as someone
              competent in predicting user confusion, and adjusting designs to ensure a smooth experience. Using my history of graphic design and video editing,
              I have also become the go-to person for animations and touches of delight.
