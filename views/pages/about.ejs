              First off, thanks for taking the time to read this! I'm sure you're busy so I'll keep it short.
            </h1>
            <p>
              To clarify,
              <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality">ENFP&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
              is a personality type (Myers Briggs), as is the
              <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7/">Enneagram 7&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>.</a>
              I find that they help provide a brief snapshot of my personality and values. Now for a little about me!
            </p>
            <p>
              I grew up in Santa Fe, and if you're homeschooled in Santa Fe like I was, you learn how to make your own fun.
              So I started avidly consuming Youtube tutorials, event planning, selling vintage at flea markets, and video editing.
              All of this led me to move to Nashville to pursue a computer science degree with a minor in entrepreneurship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that I have graduated, I am a freelance developer for a few companies, host storytelling events, and intern at
              WELD, a co-working space. Forever a student at heart, Iâ€™m still consuming tutorials and stretching myself every day.
