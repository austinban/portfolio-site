## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This app is built using npm and express.js.

### Prerequisites

If you don't already have npm, you'll need to install it to get the app running. In order to do so, run the following code in your terminal.

```
sudo npm install npm -g
```

To ensure npm installed correctly, run:

```
npm -v
```

The output should look similar to:

```
3.9.3
```

### Installing

To install node, follow the instructions found here: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node.

To ensure node installed correctly, run:

```
node -v
```

The output should look similar to:

```
v6.2.1
```

Once node is installed, all you need to do to get the app running is run the following command from the home directory:

```
npm start
```

from your home directory in terminal. The default host port is 3000, so the app can be seen on http://localhost:3000/. To terminate the local server, press `control+c`.
